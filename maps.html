			<h3>Geographical Indications of India</h3>
			   A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to 
			   a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country). 
			   The use of a geographical indication may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, 
			   is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.
			   Governments have been protecting trade names and trademarks used in relation to food products identified with 
			   a particular region since at least the end of the nineteenth century, using laws against false trade descriptions 
			   or passing off, which generally protect against suggestions that a product has a certain origin, quality or association 
			   when it does not. In such cases, the limitation on competitive freedoms which results from the grant of a monopoly of use 
			   over a geographical indication is justified by governments either by consumer protection benefits or by producer protection benefits.

   Darjeeling is a town and a municipality in the Indian state of West Bengal. 
   It is located in the Lesser Himalayas at an elevation of 6,700 ft (2,042.2 m). 
   It is noted for its tea industry, its spectacular views of the Kangchenjunga, the 
   world's third-highest mountain, and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, a UNESCO World 
   Heritage Site. Darjeeling is the headquarters of the Darjeeling District which has a
   partially autonomous status within the state of West Bengal. It is also a popular tourist destination in India.

The recorded history of the town starts from the early 19th century when the colonial a
dministration under the British Raj set up a sanatorium and a military depot in the region.
 Subsequently, extensive tea plantations were established in the region and tea growers
 developed hybrids of black tea and created new fermentation techniques. The resultant
 distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.[3]

The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway connects the town with the plains and has some of the
 few steam locomotives still in service in India.

Darjeeling has several British-style public schools, which attract pupils from all over
 India and a few neighbouring countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse
 demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepchas, Bhutia, Tibetans, and other 
 mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong,
 was the centre of the Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by
 a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.

   state in central India. Its capital is Bhopal and the largest city is Indore with Gwalior and Jabalpur being the
   other major cities. Nicknamed the "heart of India" due to its geographical location in India, Madhya Pradesh is the 
   second-largest state in the country by area. With over 75 million inhabitants, it is the fifth-largest state in India by

It is one of the most developed states in India, contributing 25% of the country's industrial output and 23.2% of its GDP (2010–11).[8] As of 2011, the state had a per capita income of ₹1.0035 lakh (US$1,600), more than the national average of ₹0.73 lakh (US$1,100). Its GDP per capita crossed the ₹1.20 lakh (US$1,900) threshold for the first time in 2013, making it one of the richest states in India. However, as of 2014, the GDP per capita reduced to ₹1.03 lakh (US$1,600).[9]

Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra since the day it was formed.The major rivers of the state are Godavari, and Krishna. The Narmada and Tapti Rivers flow near the border between Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Maharashtra is the third most urbanised state among major states in India.[10][11] Ancient and medieval Maharashtra was ruled by the Satavahana dynasty, Rashtrakuta dynasty, Western Chalukyas, Deccan sultanates, Mughals and Marathas respectively. Ruins, monuments, tombs, forts and places of worship left by these rulers are dotted around the state. They include the world heritage sites of Ajanta caves and Ellora caves. There are also numerous forts associated with the life of Shivaji Maharaj.
