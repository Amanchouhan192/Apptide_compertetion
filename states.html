			<h3>Geographical Indications of India</h3>
			   A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to 
			   a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country). 
			   The use of a geographical indication may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, 
			   is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.
			   Governments have been protecting trade names and trademarks used in relation to food products identified with 
			   a particular region since at least the end of the nineteenth century, using laws against false trade descriptions 
			   or passing off, which generally protect against suggestions that a product has a certain origin, quality or association 
			   when it does not. In such cases, the limitation on competitive freedoms which results from the grant of a monopoly of use 
			   over a geographical indication is justified by governments either by consumer protection benefits or by producer protection benefits.

   The culinary style of the region to a great extent shaped up according to the bellicose lifestyle of the natives. Unavailability of a variety of fresh vegetables, fruits and other ingredients and scarcity of water due to the arid nature of the region has profound effect on the cooking style of the locals, particularly those living in the desert pockets. Traditionally the locals preferred to prepare such items that could be retained for a few days and consumed without heating them. Paucity of water in the region has witnessed extensive use of dairy products by the inhabitants like milk, butter and butter milk so as to compensate or reduce the water content while cooking. Beans, dried lentils and legumes like gram flour, bajra and jowar form the main ingredients of many of the Rajasthani dishes. Ghee is liberally used in preparing different Rajasthani dishes which are rich in spice and flavour. Although predominantly a vegetarian region, the influence of the Rajputs who savoured non-vegetarian dishes including game meat saw the evolution of several luscious non-vegetarian dishes such as laal maas, jungle maas, khad khargosh and safed maas.

Rajasthani breads are made out of conventional staples of the region like corn, barley and millet which are grounded into flour. Breads are generally roasted in frying pans and served after adding ghee on each piece. Of late wheat flour has replaced these traditional grains to some extent.
