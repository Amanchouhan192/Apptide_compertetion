			<h3>Geographical Indications of India</h3>
			   A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to 
			   a specific geographical location or origin (e.g. a town, region, or country). 
			   The use of a geographical indication may act as a certification that the product possesses certain qualities, 
			   is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.
			   Governments have been protecting trade names and trademarks used in relation to food products identified with 
			   a particular region since at least the end of the nineteenth century, using laws against false trade descriptions 
			   or passing off, which generally protect against suggestions that a product has a certain origin, quality or association 
			   when it does not. In such cases, the limitation on competitive freedoms which results from the grant of a monopoly of use 
			   over a geographical indication is justified by governments either by consumer protection benefits or by producer protection benefits.

		<h2>Geographical Indications Of India</h2>
		<p><img src="http://www.bananaip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/640px-Geographical_Indications_in_India_collage-2-640x450.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" width="250" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5"/> Outside Asia, the Awadhi language (A Hindi language)is an official language in Fiji as per the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, where it referred to it as "Hindustani", however in the 2013 Constitution of Fiji, it is simply called "Hindi". It is spoken by 380,000 people in Fiji.
A geographical indication (GI) is a name or sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin 
(e.g. a town, region, or country). The use of a geographical indication may act as a certification that the product possesses certain
 qualities, is made according to traditional methods, or enjoys a certain reputation, due to its geographical origin.
 Governments have been protecting trade names and trademarks used in relation to food products identified with a particular region since
 at least the end of the nineteenth century, using laws against false trade descriptions or passing off, which generally protect against 
 suggestions that a product has a certain origin, quality or association when it does not. In such cases, the limitation on competitive 
 freedoms which results from the grant of a monopoly of use over a geographical indication is justified by governments either by consumer
 protection benefits or by producer protection benefits.

One of the first GI systems is the one used in France from the early part of the twentieth century known as appellation d'origine 
contrôlée (AOC). Items that meet geographical origin and quality standards may be endorsed with a government-issued stamp which acts as
 official certification of the origins and standards of the product to the consumer. Examples of products that have such 'appellations of 
 origin' include Gruyère cheese (from Switzerland) and many French wines.

Geographical indications have long been associated with the concept of terroir and with Europe as 
an entity, where there is a tradition of associating certain food products with particular regions. Under European 
Union Law, the protected designation of origin framework which came into effect in 1992 regulates the following systems 
of geographical indications: Protected designation of origin (PDO), protected geographical indication (PGI) and Traditional Specialities 
Guaranteed (TSG)
Geographical indications are generally traditional products, produced by rural communities over generations, that have gained a reputation 
on the markets for their specific qualities.

The recognition and protection on the markets of the names of these products allows the community of producers to invest in
 maintaining the specific qualities of the product on which the reputation is built. It may also allow them to invest together in
 promoting the reputation of the product.

Observed[by whom?] rural development impacts of geographical indications are:

a structuring of the supply chain around a common product reputation,
increased and stabilised prices for the GI product,
added value distributed through all the levels of the supply chain,
preservation of the natural resources on which the product is based,
preservation of traditions and traditional know-how,
linkages to tourism
None of these impacts are guaranteed and they depend on numerous factors, including the process of developing
 the geographical indications, the rules for using the GI (or Code of Practice), the inclusiveness and quality of 
 decision making of the GI producers association and quality of the marketing efforts undertaken

			  <h1>Jammu and Kashmir</h1>  is a state in northern India, often denoted by the acronym J&K. 
			  It is located mostly in the Himalayan mountains, and shares borders with the states of Himachal
			  Pradesh and Punjab to the south. Jammu and Kashmir has an international border with China in the north and east,
			  and the Line of Control separates it from the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in the west and northwest respectively. 
			  The state has special autonomy under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.

			  <h1>Rajasthan</h1>  literally, "Land of Kings"			   is India's largest state by area (342,239 square kilometres (132,139 sq mi) or 10.4% of India's total area). It is located on the north western side of the India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert
			   (also known as the "Rajasthan Desert" and "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of
			   Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by five other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast;
			   Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest.

			   <h1>Darjeeling</h1> tea is a tea from the Darjeeling district in West Bengal, India. It is available in black, green, white and oolong. When properly brewed, it yields a thin-bodied, light-coloured infusion with a floral aroma. 
			   The flavour can include a tinge of astringent tannic characteristics and a musky spiciness sometimes described as "muscatel".

              Unlike most Indian teas, Darjeeling tea is normally made from the small-leaved Chinese variety of 
			  Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, rather than the large-leaved Assam plant (C. sinensis var. assamica). 
			  Traditionally, Darjeeling tea is made as black tea; however, Darjeeling oolong and green teas are becoming more 
			  commonly produced and easier to find, and a growing number of estates are also producing white teas. After the enactment
			  of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection Act, 1999) in 2003, Darjeeling tea became the first Indian 
			  product to receive a GI tag, in 2004–05 through the Indian Patent Office.
